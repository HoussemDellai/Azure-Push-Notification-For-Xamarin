{"Name":"Android Support Library v4","Id":2603,"Alias":"xamandroidsupportv4-18","Description":"# v4 Android Support Library\n\nThis library includes support for application components, user interface features, accessibility, data handling, network connectivity, and programming utilities.\n\n\n\n\n## Android Support Libraries\n\nThe Android Support Libraries are a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries\u0027 features and still be compatible with devices running older versions of Android.\n\nIncluding the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users. \n\n\n","Version":"23.1.1.1","Summary":"Provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.","QuickStart":"The V4 Android Support Library is commonly used in applications due to it supporting many of the basic elements used within other libraries and applications.\n\nApp Components\n - Fragment - Adds support for encapsulation of user interface and functionality with Fragments, enabling applications to provide layouts that adjust between small and large-screen devices.\n - NotificationCompat - Adds support for rich notification features.\n - LocalBroadcastManager - Allows applications to easily register for and receive intents within a single application without broadcasting them globally. \n\nUser Interface\n - ViewPager - Adds a ViewGroup that manages the layout for the child views, which the user can swipe between.\n - PagerTitleStrip - Adds a non-interactive title strip, that can be added as a child of ViewPager.\n - PagerTabStrip - Adds a navigation widget for switching between paged views, that can also be used with ViewPager.\n - DrawerLayout - Adds support for creating a Navigation Drawer that can be pulled in from the edge of a window.\n - SlidingPaneLayout - Adds widget for creating linked summary and detail views that appropriately adapt to various screen sizes.\nAccessibility\n - ExploreByTouchHelper - Adds a helper class for implementing accessibility support for custom views.\n - AccessibilityEventCompat - Adds support for AccessibilityEvent. For more information about implementing accessibility, see Accessibility.\n - AccessibilityNodeInfoCompat - Adds support for AccessibilityNodeInfo.\n - AccessibilityNodeProviderCompat - Adds support for AccessibilityNodeProvider.\n - AccessibilityDelegateCompat - Adds support for View.AccessibilityDelegate.\n\nContent\n - Loader - Adds support for asynchronous loading of data.
